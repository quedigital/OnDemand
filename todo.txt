// TODO: "Changing the Font and Font Size" has a 2-part step; how do they get the first part of the text to highlight? [maybe 2 Callouts with merged text]
// TODO: style the Go Further and It's Not All Good and Tips
// TODO: make sure the Player can load from InformIT (ie, AWS) using getJSON [should work the same as the ContentViewer]
// TODO: put something at the end of the steps to take up the blank space there
// TODO: pop-up when task is complete, with next task & other search results or related tasks

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// DONE: add tour [joyride] or "chalkboard" overlay ("chalk marks")
// DONE: fit menu into left-hand column of main screen
// DONE: re-do search results
// DONE: "watch it" button on task screen doesn't toggle (visually or functionally)
// DONE: expand right column with button click (hide otherwise)
// DONE: text for home screen button
// DONE: just 2 buttons on home screen
// DONE: after each task, "Continue with next" or "Next in Search result" or "related Task"
// DONE: better fonts for home screen
// DONE: play "lesson complete" when done with slides
// DONE: scroll to current step text as slides advance
// DONE: "progress" sidebar doesn't appear at the correct times
// DONE: pad steps frame with +/- height of captivate so scrolling doesn't begin until steps are almost off-screen
// DONE: hide TOC when something else is clicked on
// DONE: make search results show all from toc
// DONE: fix sizing/placement issue of hotspots in Player on initial load
// DONE: watch and try mode
// DONE: make sure the framework can load different projects easily
// DONE: fix pathing (localhost vs. S3)
// DONE: make the steps sync with the player for Habitat content
// DONE: load project title from data file
// DONE: grab first paragraph and use that for the large, intro text
// DONE: step highlighting doesn't seem to be working
// DONE: fixing the affixing [it's not rock-solid but may be good enough, math-wise]
// DONE: consider having the watch/try visible all the time (one below the other, with jump links)
// DONE: make step text clickable to jump to that step
// DONE: put in chapter separators
// DONE: style the sidebars
// DONE: make watch it/try it tab panels again
// DONE: jump via steps needs to work for Watch and Try
// DONE: click watch/try button restarts from beginning
// DONE: try it (in container) doesn't click (first step of first lesson)
// DONE: watch it (in container) doesn't proceed
// DONE: rearrange so watch it/try it is moved up
// DONE: highlighting of steps is broken again
// DONE: reset buttons to "Watch It" when switching tasks
// DONE: pause watch when try is clicked (and vice versa)
// DONE: play/pause, prev/next controls
// DONE: nav tabs need to pause the playback too
// DONE: re-do navbars to more closely match ContentViewer's
// DONE: collapsed menu button doesn't work
// DONE: navbar elements don't fit on narrow screens
// DONE: highlighting isn't always working for Watch It
// DONE: clickable steps isn't working for Watch It; they aren't continuing
// DONE: play/pause button needs to sync with clickable steps for Watch It
// DONE: prev/next buttons on task page
// DONE: show current task in table of contents
// DONE: checkboxes for watch it/try it completion per task
// DONE: did I turn off the scroll-locking for the iframes?? [yes, I think so; back on]
// DONE: checkmark on task screen (overlaid on Watch / Try)
// DONE: temporarily hide search & browse
// DONE: "Watched It" "Tried It" for checkmarks
// DONE: front screen isn't responsive enough at small sizes
// DONE: instead of "Follow the course" and "Next up" say "Start the course" and "First up" when starting
// DONE: review resizing logic [I think]
// DONE: add Que logo to home page
// DONE: resizing throws off the click timing and destroys the audio finished callback [seems ok]
// TODONT: use just 1 iframe for both watch and try (changing modes as necessary) [getDOM will need to be refreshed, possibly for the different modes?] [nah, it would make the tab setup wonky and make it difficult to have the the watch it/try its in 2 different states]
// TODONT: make pause stop the animations too? [hides them]
// DONE: highlight current step when tabbing between watch it and try it (because it could be different)
// DONE: repeat button didn't seem to cause Pause button to appear
// DONE: does clicking steps still jump to that step?
// DONE: reset demo holder height after switching tasks [stays tall on Firefox]
// DONE: switched to jquery-2.1.4 non-min to add null checks [was null for some style tests in Firefox]
